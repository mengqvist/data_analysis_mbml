# Reproducing "Model-Based Machine Learning" Examples with Pyro

![Pyro Logo](https://pyro.ai/img/pyro_logo.png)

## Description
This project is part of my journey to learn Pyro, a universal probabilistic programming language. I'm working through examples from the excellent "Model-Based Machine Learning" book by John Winn, implementing solutions using Pyro instead of the Infer.NET framework used in the book's companion code.

## Key Features
- Implementation of Model-Based Machine Learning examples using Pyro
- Exploration of Pyro's capabilities in expressing complex probabilistic models

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the environment using Miniconda:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate pyro
   ```

## Notebooks
1. [Chapter 1](https://github.com/mengqvist/data_analysis_mbml/blob/master/MBML_book_ch1.ipynb) - Implementation of first chapter examples using Pyro.
2. [Chapter 2](https://github.com/mengqvist/data_analysis_mbml/blob/master/MBML_book_ch2.ipynb) - Implementation of second chapter examples using Pyro.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pyro 1.4.0
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib

## Future Work
- Implement more examples from the book
- Implement all examples in [NumPyro](https://num.pyro.ai/en/latest/index.html)

## How to Contribute
This is a personal learning project, but suggestions and discussions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Status
This project under sporadic development. Content and implementations may change as I progress through the book and deepen my understanding of Pyro.
